Warning: this extension will send ALL of your browsed URLs and HTML bodies to port `60606` on `127.0.0.1`.  It's an ugly hack.  Just make sure you trust anyone listening on your localhost.  

### Usage
- go to `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
- enable `developer mode` with the checkbox in the upper right corner
- click `Load unpacked extension...` at the top of the page
- direct the file browser to the cloned `chrome-extension` directory
